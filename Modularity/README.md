Modularity is a design principle in software engineering that emphasizes breaking a system down into smaller, independent, and reusable components. Modules are the fundamental building blocks of modular systems.

In Python, modules are files that contain Python code and can be imported into other Python code. Modules can provide a set of related functions, classes, and variables, and can be used to organize code into logical units.

For example, let's say we have a Python program that needs to perform various mathematical calculations. We could put all of the code for these calculations into a single file, but this could make the code difficult to read and maintain. Instead, we can create a module called math_utils.py and define all of the necessary functions in that file. Here's an example of what that might look like
